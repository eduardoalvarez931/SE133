Proposal Abstract 
The purpose of the web application, “Calorie Tracking Application” is to track the calories, sugar, fat, and protein of a user’s daily diet, as well as including a workout plan. The goal of this project is for the user to routinely add their meals to the web application to keep track of their calorie count and reach their personal goals of gaining or losing weight. This application will be useful for college students because going to school is stressful and being healthy and keeping track of calorie intake can help increase stress tolerance and help fight off diseases. By using the application, students can keep track of their calorie intake and reach their goal by the end of the day. They can also make long-term goals to gain or lose weight in a few months’ time.
